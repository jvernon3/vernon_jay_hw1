      <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>Hello! This site is about Jay Vernon, to provide you with a little more information on me. To start, I'm originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Moved to Ontario at a young age and have lived here since then. I grew up playing a high level of Hockey and Baseball, but slowly trasitioned my way out of them.
          I decided to attend Fanshawe College for Graphic design, but quickly moved on, as I'm not a fan of the foundations for it (mostly done by hand). I found the Interactive Media Design program and achieved Dean's Honours in my first term. I now play on a competitive Overwatch Esports team, and am looking
          at jobs out of the country for when I graduate. I definitely enjoy the coding in the IDP program. I feel that this is a much better fit for me, as there's more technilogical skills than design skills. To touch some of my design history, check the section below.</p>

      <h2>Design Background</h2>
        <p>Here are two of my designs from recent history. Just logo designs, but I feel it will convey an idea for my style of design. The First logo is for a company called Camerashy Images. The Second logo is for a company called Brass Ring Candle Company.</p>
